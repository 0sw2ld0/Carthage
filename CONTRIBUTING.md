### Making contributions

Please file issues or submit pull requests for anything you’d like to see! No
promises that they’ll be accepted, though—many suggestions will be rejected in
favor of simplicity.

### Reviewing contributions

Until the project is more mature, it’s in our best interest to move quickly and
keep momentum going.

Consequently:

1. Feel free to merge something after just one :+1: (from a collaborator)—no
   need to wait for everyone to chime in. If others have thoughts, they can
   always express them after the fact.
1. If a change is very small, or you’re very confident that you’ve addressed
   all review comments, please self-merge it.
1. Use pull requests for every change, no matter how small, so others can keep
   up with what’s happening in the project.
